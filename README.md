##  Key Features

- Cleaned and merged data from three CSV files:
  - `students.csv`: demographic and enrollment data
  - `course_activity.csv`: engagement logs per course
  - `feedback.csv`: user satisfaction ratings

- Performed EDA using Python:
  - Distribution of active vs inactive students
  - Average activity time by course and gender
  - Correlation between engagement and feedback

- Built 5 key visualizations:
  - Bar chart, line plot, scatter plot, heatmap, and pie chart

##  Insights & Impact

- **Course A** had the highest engagement, followed by **Course C**
- **Female students** showed slightly higher average activity time
- **Feedback ratings** were strongly aligned with engagement level
- Inactive users were highest in **Course B**, suggesting content or delivery issues
